(20/12/2020) Binary Tree {with Search} - Java

I created a binary tree by creating a Node class with has left Node object, right Node object and Integer value. Inside it there are functions that allow you to add nodes, get the node value and the value of the left or right node. There is a dfs(); function allowing all the nodes connected to the parent and children nodes to be explored using a depth-first search. Then for the main tree, it has a root Node object and add a inTree(); function that searches for a value n and returns a true/false value if it is in the tree or not. There is a traverse(); function also allowing the tree to be traversed depth-first. Essentially, the Tree object is just a wrapper for the Node object.
